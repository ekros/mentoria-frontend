# todo-react

**Ths assessment is based on the MDN to-do app. The original README can be found below these lines. The assessment can be found in the `assessment` branch. The final solution is in the `main` branch. Some tests have been to evaluate progress (they can be run by typing `npm run test`).

There are some missing parts in the code (some lines, only partially) that are required for the tests to pass. They are marked with a comment and an exclamation (if you install the Better Comments extension on vscode they will be displayed in red color).

This can be completed in 1-2 hours.**
