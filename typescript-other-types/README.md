# Typescript primitives

This is a simple project to practice with other TS types (not primitives)

## Prerequisites

Install compiler globally:

```bash
npm i typescript -g
```

Then you can run:
```bash
tsc example1.ts
```

Once compiled you can run the file using node:
```bash
node example1.js
```
